            EduLink, developed during my Post Graduate Diploma Degree in
            Computer Science at UniAbuja, addresses the challenge of scheduling
            academic appointments efficiently. The platform allows the Head of
            Department (HOD) to set their available days for meetings, while
            students can book appointments with ease. To ensure timely
            scheduling, students can book appointments up to one day before the
            available dates.
          </p>
          <p className='font-light'>
            Built with Next.js and Supabase, EduLink provides a seamless
            experience for both administrators and students. TypeScript ensures
            type safety, Prisma handles data management, and Tailwind CSS
            delivers a responsive, clean design.

            <p className='font-light'>
              One significant challenge was implementing a dynamic scheduling
              system that manages appointment bookings and notifications
              efficiently. Integrating an email service was crucial for keeping
              students informed about their appointment status, and I learned
              valuable skills in incorporating email notifications into
              projects.

            This project provided valuable experience in handling appointment
            scheduling and automated notifications. It also learnt how to
            integrate email services into projects effectively.
