            This project was created for my church&apos;s ministry, showcasing
            church details and including daily devotionals that we send to
            members. Previously, our devotionals were sent via WhatsApp, but
            they were often delayed. The solution was to implement a feature on
            the web app where the daily devotional automatically displays at 12
            midnight for the corresponding day.
          </p>
          <p className='font-light'>
            Additional features include information on church programs,
            branches, giving options, sermons, and how to join services online,
            along with a contact form that sends messages to the ministry email.
            It was built with NextJs, Tailwind, Typescript, Prisma, Supabase,
            Date Fns, Resend and Zod.

              Technical Challenges & Solutions üí°
            </h2>
            <p className='font-light'>
              The biggest challenge was ensuring the devotional for each day
              only becomes visible at 12 midnight, even if devotionals for the
              week or month had already been uploaded. I used the date-fns
              library and javaScript logic to manage the display and restrict
              access to only the current day&apos;s devotional.

          <p className='font-light'>
            One of the things I plan to add is a section for tracking church
            finances, as we currently rely on a third-party service for that.
            This feature will provide a more integrated experience for both the
            church administration.

          <p className='font-light'>
            This project enhanced my skills in handling data manipulation and
            controlling time-based content display. Managing the devotional
            uploads and visibility was a key learning experience.
